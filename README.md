# Introduction - MAT.OCS.Streaming Library

This API provides infrastructure for streaming data around the ATLAS technology platform. 

Using this API, you can: 
* Subscribe to streams of engineering values - no ATLAS recorder required 
* Inject parameters and aggregates back into the ATLAS ecosystem 
* Build up complex processing pipelines that automatically process new sessions as they are generated 

With support for Apache Kafka, the streaming API also offers: 
* Late-join capability - clients can stream from the start of a live session 
* Replay of historic streams 
* Fault-tolerant, scalable broker architecture 

## Knowledgebase
Be sure to look at our support knowledgebase on Zendesk: https://mclarenappliedtechnologies.zendesk.com/

## Scope
This pre-release version of the API demonstrates the event-based messaging approach, for sessions and simple telemetry data. 

Future versions will model all ATLAS entities, and likely offer better support for aggregates and predictive models.
